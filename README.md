# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

I was approached with a special project in the MechaCar, a prototype from AutosRUs'. I  helped Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other      manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, youâ€™ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

After summarizing our MPG data:

- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  - According to our data vehicle_length(p-value 2.6 x 10^-12) and ground_clearance (p-value 5.21x10^-8) provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. The intercept is also a non-random amount of variance which may indicate additional data needed.

- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  - The slope of the linear model is considered to be not zero. According to the data it has a p-value of 5.35x10^-11. The null hypothesis must be rejected as an extreme level of significance is shown. Our variables and the MPG is subject to more than random chance. 

- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  - With a r-squared value of .7149 indicates our model being 71% accurate. With this model we can somewhat reliably predict the effectiveness of the Mechacar prototype.  

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

After summarizing our Suspension Data:

- Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
  - The total_summary data shows the overall variance is under PSI and within specifications. However on the lot_summary table the variance on Lot3 is over the acceptable threshold at 170.286.

 ## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
 
 Overall T-test results across all manufacturing lots and for each lot:

- The results of the suspension coils accross all manufacturing lots in this T-test shows a p-value of .06028 indicating the manufacturers are not statistically different from the population mean, this enough to reject the null hypothesis.

- The T-test results for Lot 1 shows a p-value of 1 indicating they are not statistically different from the population mean, therefor we can not reject the null hypothesis.

- The T-test results for Lot 2 suspension coils shows a p-value of .6072 and they are not statistically different from the population mean, therefor we can not reject the null hypothesis.

 - The T-test results for Lot 3 shows a p-value of .0417 and they are barely statistically different from the population mean, therefor we can reject the null hypothesis. Lot 3 needs to be looked at or discarded.
